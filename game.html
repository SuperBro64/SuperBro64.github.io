            Description
        </h2>

        <p>
            Take control of legendary explorer Hyperion and guide him through a dangerous labyrinth full of traps and treasure!
            In each level you must solve puzzles and navigate obstacles to reach the goal before time runs out, collecting as
            much treasure as you can along the way. Successfully clear a level in time to increase your overall completion
            percentage. Collect all of the treasure in the level first to increase your completion percentage even more! Can you
            clear every level and reach 101% total completion? Good luck!
        </p>
